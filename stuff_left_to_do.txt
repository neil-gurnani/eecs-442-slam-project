Things to do:

Essential:
1) integrate feature mapping, replace fake features
2) add more points to map
3) potentially compute homography
4) write the report
5) make presentation
6) integrate with visualization
7) maybe do projects with our own cameras (stretch)
8) bundle adjustment optimization (stretch)
