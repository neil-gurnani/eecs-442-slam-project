Things to do:

Essential:
1) integrate feature mapping, replace fake features -> tommy
2) add more points to map  -> tommy
3) potentially compute homography  -> Nick
4) write the report  -> Nick will start
5) make presentation -> Nick will start
6) integrate with visualization ->  Nick
7) maybe do projects with our own cameras (stretch) -> Neil/James
8) bundle adjustment optimization (stretch) -> we shall see
9) show ground truth (camera trajectory) -> Nick
